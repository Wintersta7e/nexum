//! Project identity resolution per §13 of the design spec.
//!
//! `resolve(input) -> ProjectResolution` composes the §13 resolution order:
//!   1. `git_origin_url` (canonicalized) — the strongest signal.
//!   2. Registered project name from the user's `nexum` config, when supplied.
//!   3. Path-based identity from canonicalized cwd (or, for CC, from one of the
//!      slug-decoded path candidates).
//!
//! CC slug decoding is best-effort: the `/` → `-` substitution doesn't
//! roundtrip when path components contain hyphens. When the slug is ambiguous
//! and no higher-priority signal applies, `resolve()` returns
//! `ProjectResolution::Ambiguous` rather than auto-picking a candidate.
